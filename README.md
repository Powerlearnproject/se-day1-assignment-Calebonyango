#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

This is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. 
It is essential in the tech industry as it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life in fields like healthcare, commerce and entertainment among many more.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Development of programming languages. For instance, the development of C language, a structured programming language that emphasized control structures like loops, conditionals, and functions to create more readable and modular code.
The Rise of Agile Methodologies in the early 2000s, which transformed software engineering by advocating for iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility in response to changing requirements.
The term software engineering was first introduced in 1968 at the NATO Software Engineering Conference. This landmark event marked the beginning of efforts to address the challenges of software development through systematic, engineering-based approaches. 
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, firstly introduced in 1968 at the NATO Software Engineering Conference. This landmark event marked the beginning of efforts to address the challenges of software development through systematic, engineering-based approaches. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements
Involves gathering and analyzing the needs and expectations of users and stakeholders to understand what the software should achieve. Requirements are documented, and feasibility studies are often conducted to determine the project's viability. This stage sets the foundation for design and development.

System Design
Here, the requirements are translated into a blueprint for the software. This includes defining system architecture, data flow, interfaces, and modules. High-level design documents specify the overall structure, while detailed design focuses on individual components, preparing for the actual coding phase.

Implementation 
The development team writes the code according to the specifications laid out in the design phase. This phase involves actual programming, converting design into executable software. Developers work in their specific areas or modules, ensuring all components meet the design standards.

Testing
After development, the software undergoes rigorous testing to detect and fix bugs or issues. This includes functional, performance, security, and user acceptance testing to ensure the software works as intended and meets quality standards. Testing ensures the software is reliable and meets user needs before deployment.

Deployment
In this phase, the tested software is released to the production environment and made available to users. Deployment can be done in stages (for example, a beta release) or all at once, depending on the project requirements. This phase also includes creating support documentation for users.

Maintenance
Post-deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for bugs, performance issues, or new requirements. Regular updates, patches, and enhancements are applied to keep the software relevant, secure, and efficient as user needs or environments evolve.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development. Each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance) must be completed before moving to the next whereas agile methodology is an iterative and flexible approach where software is developed incrementally, with frequent adjustments based on user and team feedback and changing requirements. A software company building a compliance system for a financial institution would benefit from the Waterfall model while a startup developing a social media app would benefit from Agile.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An Integrated Development Environment  provides a comprehensive workspace that combines various development tools into a single, unified interface and are designed to improve productivity by integrating code editing, debugging, and testing tools, which allows developers to work more efficiently. For instance, Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA
A Version Control System helps manage changes to source code over time as it allows devlopers to track modifications, revert to previous versions, and collaborate effectively on codebases. Examples is , Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing Changing Requirements
Requirements in software projects can change frequently during the development cycle,leading to scope creep and project delays and this could be overcome by adopting Agile Practices like Scrum and Kanban that allow for iterative development, making it easier to adapt to changes and incorporate feedback.
Meeting Deadlines Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality due to stress, burnout, or rush and error-prone coding. Setting realistic milestones could help by breaking down projects into smaller, manageable tasks with achievable milestones. Prioritize tasks to focus on what matters most and prevent burnout or either employ they use of project management tools like JIRA, Trello, or Asana to help track progress, set priorities, and allocate resources efficiently.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: focuses on verifying the smallest parts of a software application, usually individual functions or methods within a module.
Integration Testing: verifies the interactions between different components or modules of an application.
System Testing: is a comprehensive evaluation of the entire application as a whole, testing it in an environment that closely resembles production.
Acceptance Testing: is the final phase of testing and is conducted to determine whether the software is ready for release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the art of crafting and refining inputs or statements called prompts,given to AI language models to generate accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses. It is essential in improving response quality and relevance, facilitating complex task execution and enhancing efficiency and reducing iterations.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Generate the names of presidents and their countries."
"Generate the names of African Presidents in an alphabetical order, followed by their respective countries in a tabular format."
